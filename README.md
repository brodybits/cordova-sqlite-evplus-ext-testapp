**NOTE:** This project includes JQuery (2.2.4) and Bootstrap (3.3.6) under the MIT license. Otherwise there is no code copied from other sources.

**IMPORTANT:** Whitelist and intent items are omitted from this test app.

**NOTICE:** This test does not work on macOS ("osx") since it is not supported by `cordova-plugin-dialogs`.

## Dependencies

- Bootstrap (3.3.6) - included (MIT license)
- JQuery (2.2.4) - included (MIT license)
- `cordova-plugin-dialogs` - specified in `config.xml`
- `cordova-sqlite-evplus-ext-free` (0.3.0-pre1) from <https://github.com/brodybits/cordova-sqlite-evplus-ext-free> - added by the following command:
  - `cordova plugin add https://github.com/brodybits/cordova-sqlite-evplus-ext-free#0.3.0-pre1`

NOTE: `cordova-plugin-dialogs` was added using the `--save` flag to ensure that this plugin would be automatically installed. It is recommended to use the `--save` flags to add any other plugins rather than adding such plugins to git.

## To add another plugin

```shell
cordova plugin add my-plugin-id --save
```

## How to run

1. Add the desired Cordova sqlite plugin version, for example:

```shell
cordova plugin add cordova-sqlite-storage --save
```

2. Add the desired platform(s), for example:

```shell
cordova platform add android
```

3. Do `cordova prepare` (may not always be necessary but good to be on the safe side):

```shell
cordova prepare
```

4. Run it on your mobile emulator or device, for example:

```shell
cordova run android
```

## Functionality

- Upon startup: open a database and CREATE the test table
- Native alert dialog test
- Echo test
- Self test
- Location reload
- String test 1
- String test 2 (string as a SQL parameter)
- Show record
- Add record
- Add 100 records from JavaScript object after delay
- Delete all records
- Follow link to page 2
- Change window.location to page 2

## Multi-page test

It is possible to switch between two pages using "follow link" buttons. The main page also has a button to go to page 2 by changing `window.location`. There is also a button on both pages to try `location.reload()`.

The sqlite plugin should continue to work after the user changes to another page or triggers `location.reload()`.
